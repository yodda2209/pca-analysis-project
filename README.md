#  PCA Analysis Project

This project demonstrates the application of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** â€“ a data mining and machine learning algorithm used for **dimensionality reduction**.

---

##  Objective

Reduce high-dimensional data to principal components that retain the most variance while simplifying the feature space.

---

##  What I Did

- Standardized the dataset
- Applied PCA
- Visualized explained variance
- Reduced features while retaining essential information

---

##  Key Insights

- PCA successfully reduced dimensions while maintaining interpretability.
- Top components captured most of the variance.
- Simplified dataset can improve ML model performance and clarity.

---

##  Tools Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
